The 2022 game had the robots try and traverse a climbing frame, this is us testing our mechanism.

Closeup of our climbing hook. We had to buy this piece because we don't have easy access to fabricate.

Part of the challenge is responding to problems. Here someone is on the playing field before a game trying to fix a problem by plugging directly into the robot.

Our first foray into CAD and machining during the 2021 virtual season. One our team designed the metal plates and we sent it to a friend of a mentor in Atlanta to be cut out. The price was good, but it took almost 3 weeks to get back.

In 2020 robots had to climb up a balance beam. With careful coordination of other alliance members, it's possible to get all 3 robots on the beam.

We were on the winning alliance so got a coveted blue banner.
