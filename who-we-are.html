								<h3>Team Info:</h3>
								<p>We are an FRC team based in the Burke/Springfield area. Unlike many teams sponsored by a single school and limited to students from that school, we are a community team open to students from various schools, including Braddock, West Springfield, Lee, homeschooled students, and others.</p>

								<p>No prior experience is required to join. There is something for everyone to contribute. A freshman may join with no experience and, by junior or senior year, grow into a team captain.</p>
									
								<p>Within our team, we are organized into smaller subteams:</p>
								<ul>	
									<li>Build: Focuses on the mechanical design of robot parts such as the drivetrain, shooter, climber, or intake.</li>
									<li>Electronics: Handles the wiring of control systems, sensors, motors, and pneumatics.</li>
									<li>Programming: Develops software to run the robot autonomously and via driver control, including computer vision.</li>
									<p>You are not required to commit to a single group. Team members often move between groups based on the project phase or their evolving interests.</p>
								</ul>
								<p>During competitions, things change. While a small team of four handles driving the robot, everyone else plays a crucial role in repairing and refreshing the robot between matches, as well as scouting other teams.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>Time commmitment:</h4>
								<p>We understand that everyone has other commitments. Our schedule is largely based on the availability of our students and mentors. Typically, we meet two evenings during the week and all day on Saturdays. As competitions approach, we may meet more frequently, or individual subteams may decide to schedule additional meetings. Attendance at all meetings is not required â€”- most members do not attend every session.</p>

								<p>Outside of the build season, meetings are minimal. Once the final competition ends, we typically take a break until October, when we hold a few interest sessions to regroup and prepare for the upcoming year.</p>
