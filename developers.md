# Resources for developers

## Getting started
First make sure you have WPIlib and Vscode installed - [instructions](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/1027503-installing-c-and-java-development-tools-for-frc)

Install [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (even if you want to use git from inside vscode, this is helpful)

A [git tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

Create an account on [github.com](https://github.com) and give your userid to one of the programming mentors to be added to our organization.

## Some particular topics to understand and get code from

* [Command based programming](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/commandbased/index.html) - the basics of programming the bot.
* [Changes to command based programming](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/commandbased/command-based-changes.html) - it all changes this year
* [Kinematics and odometry](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/kinematics-and-odometry/index.html) - have the robot understand where it is on the field
* [PIDSubsystem](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/cpp/l/241901-pidsubsystems-for-built-in-pid-control) - a class to drive a motor to a particular position using a PID
* [Vision](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/vision-processing/index.html) - see especially the GRIP and RPi options
* [Trajectory generation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/wpilib-tools/path-planning/wpilib-trajectories/trajectorygeneration.html) - drive the robot smoothly from point A to point B

## Tools and Links
