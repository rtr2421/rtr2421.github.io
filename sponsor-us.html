								<h3>Sponsors:</h3>
                                <p>RTR Team Robotics would be grateful for your sponsorship. Sponsors are what keeps our team afloat, from providing for entry fees to competitions, paying storage and build site costs, and replacing pieces of the robot. The team is a 501(c)(3) non profit, and every dollar that comes in goes to work to help us teach youth about STEM. We are able to take sponsorship in the form of money, or in kind.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Sponsor Levels</h4>
								<p>People and organizations that sponsor will be getting their names in front of both youth and adults in the area who have a keen interest in STEM. Whether you’re looking to reach out to potential customers, or future employees, we have sponsor levels to help.</p>

                                <p>Supporter ($250-$499) - Logos featured on our robot and web page</p>
                                <p>Collaborator ($500-$999) - Supporter, plus a logo on our sponsor banner in the pit area</p>
                                <p>Partner ($999-$2,499) - Collaborator, plus a logo on our team T-shirt</p>
                                <p>Champion ($2,500+) - Our Champions are announced during competitions, and are registered with FIRST so will show up as an official sponsor.</p>
                                
                                <hr />

                                <h4>Monetary Sponsorships:</h4>
                                <p>It costs around $15,000 per year to field a competitive team, which covers:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>$10,000 - Team registration, two district competitions, and district championship.</li>
                                    <li>$2,500 - Robot parts, raw materials, and tools.</li>
                                    <li>$2,500 - Insurance, off season storage, support at events.</li>
                                    <p>We reuse most parts from year to year, and this budget doesn’t cover large purchases that will help our competitiveness:</p>
                                    
                                    <li>$1,000 - Control systems refresh and new batteries.</li>
                                    <li>$1,500 - Upgrading our motors from the stock parts to brushless which are lighter and more powerful.</li>
                                    <li>$3,000 - Upgrading our drive train to Swerve, which increases our agility on the field (x2).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h4>Other Sponsorships</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Build space - we rely on donated space which is only available from November through May. Off season build space would let us continue our program year round and even work with the middle school leagues.</li>
                                    <li>Fabrication - Machining/CNC services would let us build more complicated mechanisms rather than having to hand cut pieces.</li>
                                </ul>
