# RTR Robotics 2421

RTR Robotics 2421 is a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team based in Springfield, VA. We are a community team and open to all high school students. We meet at a site in Springfield Plaza, between the former location of Giant and Sherwin-Williams (6422A Springfield Plaza, Springfield, VA 22150)

## 2022 results

Our 2022 robot, HermEx, made it to the Chesapeake districts finals. We placed 25th in the district and didn't advance to the World Championships.
