# RTR Robotics 2421

RTR Robotics 2421 is a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team based in Springfield, VA. We are a community team and open to all high school students. We meet at a site in Springfield Plaza, between the former location of Giant and Sherwin-Williams (6422A Springfield Plaza, Springfield, VA 22150)

We will be starting the year with an open house. Join us at King's Park Library on September 20 at 7pm.

We're looking for students who will be in grade 9-12 next year, but anyone is welcome to check us out.

## 2022 results

Our 2022 robot, HermEx, made it to the Chesapeake districts finals. We placed 25th in the district. Good luck to those who advanced to the World Championships!
