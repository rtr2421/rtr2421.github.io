# Springfield Plaza RTR Robotics 2421

RTR Robotics 2421 is a [FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) team based in Springfield, VA. We are a community team and open to all high school students. 

We're looking for students who will be in grade 9-12 next year, but anyone is welcome to check us out.

# Please help!

Our usual space at Springfield Plaza is unavailable so we have no where to meet this year. If we can't find a spot, we won't be able to participate in the upcoming season. If you know of any places that would be willing to work with us, please email [Deanne Mahoney](mailto:first2421@gmail.com). 

## 2022 results

Our 2022 robot, HermEx, made it to the Chesapeake districts finals. We placed 25th in the district. Good luck to those who advanced to the World Championships!
