# RTR Robotics 2421

RTR Robotics 2421 is a [FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) team based in Springfield, VA. We are a community team and open to all high school students. 

We're looking for students who will be in grade 9-12, but anyone is welcome to check us out.

# Please help!

We're on the lookout for space to work during the off-season and/or next season.

Our usual space at Springfield Plaza is unavailable, and [Springfield United Methodist Church](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gniPeEpstnMLA1E6A) has graciously allowed us to work there for the season. If you know of any places that would be willing to work with us, please email [Deanne Mahoney](mailto:first2421@gmail.com).
