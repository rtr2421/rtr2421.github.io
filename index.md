# RTR Robotics 2421

RTR Robotics 2421 is a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team based in Springfield, VA. We are a community team and open to all high school students. We meet at a site in Springfield Plaza, between the former location of Giant and Sherwin-Williams.

## Announcing Robo Fett

Robo Fett was our 2020 robot. 2021 was a virtual year and we didn't make a video of it.

## Upcoming meetings

  We will be moving into the build site on the afternoon of November 7. 
  We will meet at the build site (6422 Springfield Plaza Dr) at 1:30pm. 
   From there we will then proceed to the Public Storage facility at 7400

  car that can carry bins, please bring it.  If the weather is really bad,
  we will try again, probably the next weekend.
