# RTR Robotics 2421

RTR Robotics 2421 is a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team based in Springfield, VA. We are a community team and open to all high school students. We meet at a site in Springfield Plaza, between the former location of Giant and Sherwin-Williams.

## Announcing Robo Fett

Robo Fett was our 2020 robot. 2021 was a virtual year and we didn't make a video of it.
